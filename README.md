# Coral-Mapping
Coral mapping in Wakatobi Regency using Lyzenga Algorithm and K-Means Clustering. Wangi-wangi Island is one of the islands in the Wakatobi Regency. Wangi-wangi 
Island has diverse coral reef biodiversity. Coral reefs are an important part of the 
marine ecosystem. Ecologically, coral reefs serve as nutrient providers for various 
marine biota. Although coral reefs play a crucial role in the ecosystem, globally, 
coral reefs are experiencing a decline. The aim of this study is to observe the growth 
of coral reef area on Wangi-wangi Island from 2020 to 2023. The method used in 
this study is remote sensing using Sentinel 2-A satellite imagery data and the 
unsupervised classification method (K-Means Clustering).
